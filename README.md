# youtubeChatbot
Simple chatbot for youtube.
Using this partly as a learning experiance of the youtube APIs, and not expecting anyone to want to use this in anyway.

In the end I hope that this can function as a bot inside a youtube livestream chat to automate certain basic tasks.

# idea board

+ poll option
+ uptime
+ auto responses
+ anything else I can think of outside of the last 20 seconds.

# note
tokens to contact the Google APIs are not included for obvious reasons. create your own src/main/java/uk/co/codingentity/youtubechatbot/Secrets.Java file with the clientID and clientSecret if you want to test :)
Instruction for getting the tokens are [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)
